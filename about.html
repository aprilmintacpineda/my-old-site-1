			<h3>As a Software Engineer</h3>
			<p>I make softwares and I make them as <strong>sexy</strong> and as <strong>beautiful</strong> as possible from the inside-out.</p>
			<p class="text-default">I care a lot about the software's code architecture and workflow. Often, I will resort to using Native over an external library or framework to make sure that I have 100% control and flexibility over the codes that I write. I believe that the code's architecture and workflow is the key to maintainable, readable, simple to test and understand, scalable, and usable software, libararies often destroy this key. As I create my creations, I have one rule that I keep in mind: Do it right the first time. Because I know, from experience and instinct, that the further the progress goes, the harder it is to go back and correct a mistakes that we gave a guilt-free pass. Refactoring may cause breaking changes that may cause the project to be delayed.</p>

			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>I studied primary education (elementary) at <a class="a-default" href="https://bagonglotees.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Bagong Lote Elementary School</a> from 2001 to 2004. Then transfered to <a class="a-default" href="https://www.facebook.com/Sta-Quiteria-Elementary-School-288164924087/" target="_blank">Sta. Quiteria Elementary School</a> where I continued my primary education from 2004 to 2007.</p>
			<p>I took my secondary education (Highschool) at <a class="a-default" href="https://www.facebook.com/BaesaHighSchool" target="_blank">Baesa Highschool</a> from 2007 to 2009. Then transfered to <a class="a-default" href="https://www.facebook.com/SBCVOFFICIALPAGE" target="_blank">St. Bernadette College of Valenzuela</a> where I continued my secondary education from 2009 to 2011.</p>
			<p>I took <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information and Technology</strong> at <a class="a-default" href="https://www.fatima.edu.ph/" target="_blank">Our Lady of Fatima University</a> from 2011 to 2012, we didn't have enough money for my post-secondary education but my parents tried as best as they could, sadly I had to stop early on my 2nd year where we really didn't have enough money, I even remember walking from home to school, without any money on my pocket, just so I can attend our classes. I spent my entire savings just so I can go to school. After that, I applied to as many jobs as I could, but the odds were against me.</p>
			<p>Then on 2013, I found <a class="a-default" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/National-College-of-Science-and-Technology-NCST/191049267599877?ref=br_rs" target="_blank">National College of Science and Technology</a> where I studied <strong>Certificate in Manufacturing Technology</strong>, they offered a <strong>study-now-pay-later program</strong> where the <strong>pay-later part</strong> will be possible on your <strong>In-Plant</strong> training where you will actually work as a <strong>Production Operator</strong> for 1 year for a company. I was one of the batch 45, we were deployed at <a class="a-default" href="http://www.hayakawa.com.ph/" target="_blank">Hayakawa Electronics Philippines Corporation</a> on our <strong>In-Plant Training</strong>. After the <strong>In-Plant Training</strong>, we still had 3 more subjects to complete. I completed the 2 subjects but the last subject was not available, but they said we can take that subject at another campus which was around 4 to 5 hours ride from my house, so instead of completing that one last subject, despite the consequent of not graduating, I decided to go back home to Manila on December of 2014 since my mom asked me to and I didn't have enough money to support myself, I could have looked for a job, but then even <strong>looking</strong> for a job requires money.</p>
			<p>Once again I enrolled as <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong> at <a class="a-default" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/College-of-St-Catherine-Quezon-City/197624953605853" target="_blank">College of St. Catherine Quezon City</a>. Having an idea of what will come in the future was very handy, I was able to advanced myself through internet research (Google, YouTube, etc.), I was so into what I am studying that I did not realize that I have advance myself to the point that I became an amateur with skills of a well experienced. It was that time when I realized that this is what I would do in my life, it literally felt like I had a super power to create anything that I can think of, I simply imagine it, then I work on it and make it a reality. Unfortunately, I was only able to finish until 1st semester of my 3rd year on 2017, and the reason, once again, is because we no longer had enough money.</p>
